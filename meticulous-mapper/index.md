## Background

Kent is an active member of New York City’s civic tech community. He has been passionate about civic tech since he discovered it while studying for his BA in Urban Planning at University of Pennsylvania. After taking a class in GIS, he started learning data skills through youtube videos and online forums. He found a Facebook group of Philadelphia-based technologists especially helpful. After playing around with web development for a couple of years after college, he moved to New York to pursue a Masters in Computer Science at NYU.

In New York he started attending monthly meetups of people working in civic tech in the city, such as those organized by BetaNYC and Civic Hall. It is at one of those events where he met the founder of the civic mapping startup he currently works at, based out of a co-working space in Chelsea. He values the opportunity to merge his interests in urban planning and civic tech through his job, and pulls from a variety of data sources to do his job.

Kent stays up to date with events and projects in the local civic tech community through newsletters and slack teams. He regularly updates and builds out new side projects in Github, and shares his progress in online forums so that he can collaborate on new projects with others in the community. Most of the time, his projects are inspired by interesting datasets he comes across, but sometimes he responds to requests. Recently, someone from the Department of Education asked him to create an app to map schools with the lowest attendance levels.

## Experience Using Open Data

Kent is very familiar with open data, since he needs to use it every day for his job as a web developer, and in his civic  tech-focused side projects. To update, maintain, and build out the platform he develops as his day job, he pulls API’s from many sources, both open and private. Most often, he will pull City data from PLUTO and Big Apple Bytes; he can’t remember the last time he went to the Open Data portal.

Kent worked with open datasets from the city before the portal was created, and still prefers to go straight to the source, such as the specific agency websites. He feels that agencies have more incentive to update their own agency webpage, and he isn’t sure how often the portal datasets are updated or who handles quality assurance for this centralized platform. When searching for a particularly obscure dataset, he will start with a google search rather than on a data portal.

Because of the education app he recently created, he has made connections at different agencies. He relies a lot on these personal networks to get the data he is looking for when he can’t find it readily available on city agency websites. When he does use the open data portal he makes sure he uses a data downloader app that his friend made to cut through the noise.
