## Background

Marcus currently lives in Gowanus, Brooklyn with his husband and his two children. He grew up with an intersection of interests that spanned biology, physics, and the internet. Moving to New York City shortly after college, he taught himself computer development and started working at an IT company. The company was a great fit for his self-starter attitude and offered countless professional development opportunities—including trips to expensive technology  conferences.

After a ten year stretch in IT, Marcus was ready to blend his love of technology and young adults and began working as a Tech Educator at the local community college. As he transitioned into the education sector, he missed the formal professional development opportunities once so amply provided. Reaching out to his director with these concerns, he was able to get sign-off to take a free online class during business hours and enlisted a coworker for motivation and support. Together, they set aside time to watch videos and complete assignments.

Outside of work, Marcus is moderately active in his community. He started going to community board meetings when his children were small and has made a habit of sticking with it when he can. He spends his weekends volunteering with the Gowanus Conservancy—whether it is working outside or helping them do research, he seems to alway find himself of use to this organization.

## Experience Using Open Data

Marcus has recently become familiar with the open data portal—at first glance he is much more impressed with it over other data sites he has accessed—but hasn’t found a way to use it. He has browsed through a few data sets and downloaded a subset of 311 data were explored what different complaints were close to the Gowanus canal—toying with different ideas to support the Conservancy efforts, but nothing really came of it.

Although Marcus doesn’t have a lot of experience with the open data portal, he has accessed national open data sources in the past. Last month, he attended a Climate Data Jam where he examined climate data, and designed a storytelling project to a non-scientist audience.
