quote: “Open data is in world full of technical people. I am torn about this, on one hand it's  important for the city to provide broad data, on the other hand, it causes average citizens to become reliant on technologists.”

## Background

As Roman was growing up he tended to gravitate towards playing with computers and inventing things. Shortly after graduating from college, he began working in data entry for a health services company. He found the job boring, but became interested in tracking his daily entry outcomes and comparing them to a few coworkers.

His interest in outcomes led him to work at a nonprofit in his neighborhood. Roman’s problem-solving nature has granted him the opportunity to wear many hats at this agile organization including resident IT expert, webmaster, and number cruncher. He values data-driven decisionmaking and finds himself pushing his organization to make choices that save capital, but he lacks the resources, internal buy-in, and spare time to create an efficient process his team members would adhere to.

After work, Roman is actively involved in his community. He has been working on a number of side projects and tends to meet with his collaborators at the Bronx Library. Last year, while him and a few friends were organizing to help low-income families get access to eyeglasses, he asked a librarian to help him identify information pertaining to the number of of families who live at or below the poverty line and received shrugged shoulders in return. This has always bugged him. Libraries were supposed to be source of knowledge and they couldn’t help him gather information about his problem?

## Experience Using Open Data

Roman’s largest after-work project is a database he has built using Excel oriented towards both lenders and housing advocates to understand the physical conditions of buildings all over the city. He has hunted down and cleaned an extensive amount of permit, regulation, and 311 data through a combination of the HPD portals, agency websites, and occasionally the open data portal.

Roman believes in making open source tools that collect and frame raw data in a neutral way, rather than pointing out possible insights or suggesting decisions. He wants to create tools that bring together essential data sets to empower people to utilize open data to make decisions about their community.

In the past he has brought together community groups and lenders to better understand if his database is serving their needs or not—but most of the time he gets feedback much more informally. Often community members will call him up to ask all kinds of questions—about  Excel, a dataset, or certain policies.

Although Roman hasn’t talked with a manager of a city data set, the understandable operational and bureaucratic barriers associated with city agencies makes him skeptical about the reliability of open data. Recognizing that much of the data can be political, he understands that while the more “juicy” data he desires may exist somewhere within an agency, and he doubts he will ever get his hands on it.
