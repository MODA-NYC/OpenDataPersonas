## Background

Being the daughter of two immigrants from northern Mexico, Alana has always felt strongly about protecting immigrants in the city, As she grew up in Borough Park, Brooklyn, she remembers translating basic forms and signs for her parents.

After graduating from college, Alana started working as a paralegal at a nonprofit organization.There, she learned how to use open information databases to collect newspaper articles, court rulings, and other materials that could be used as evidence in cases. Shortly after joining this nonprofit organization—a few of her colleagues began the process of unionizing. Rather than sit on the sidelines, Alana knew it was the right thing to join in. Once she got over her fear, she became a central leader in this effort—she had caught the organizing bug.

After leaving this job, she continued the community organizing and built a strong network of friends dedicated toward creating fairer policies for the city’s immigrants. Five years ago, she made the decision to quit her job and with three of her friends to formalize their community organizing into their own nonprofit.

Alana is deeply connected to her community, because it is her role to engage them and advocate on their behalf every day. She frequently scans the websites of city agencies and City Council representatives to learn about town halls she can attend or new legislation that affects her community.

## Experience Using Open Data

Alana has minimal experience with data. Because her past experience in research, she learned how to search for and identify relevant information, and she is able to determine what datasets could be useful to her when she goes into the open data portal. But since she works so closely with vulnerable members of community, she has witnessed first hand how there are multiple barriers to accessing information for immigrants.

She recently organized a campaign around fair pay that took place in a selection of local public schools, because she knows that many families in her community don’t own computers or internet connections at home, so the likeliest place where they can access online information or learn about city resources is through their children attending school. That is why Alana and her team focus more of their energy on producing one-pagers that can be easily distributed in classrooms and taken home, rather than online resources. To pull together this information and visualize it, she coordinates with friends who have the design and technological skills. She doesn’t have time to learn these skills herself, and draws energy from the close collaboration with her colleagues.

Alana is concerned about privacy and security issues around data. Recently, her organization hired a group of volunteers to develop a coding system for their internal database, to protect sensitive information about undocumented immigrants who are members of her organization.

Alana has a general sense of what open data means, and has seen the term pop up more recently in Mayor’s Office press releases. She doesn’t think that open data is relevant to her work though, and leaves it to a data analyst at her organization to pull out and analyze the open datasets they need to advocate for issues that affect their community members.
