quote: “We don’t want to be the stereotype, and we don’t want to be tone deaf to the communities who have been working on these issues for years. For us, it’s not about how quickly we can get the data out there, but rather it’s about the impact.”

## Background

Shortly after graduating from NYU, June began working at a think tank focused on transportation issues for New York. In her role, she was quickly confronted with massive amounts of data and very little experience. During her first few months, she relied on coworkers to explain the technicalities of transportation data in layman’s terms. With the help of her supportive and tech-savvy relationships she has become fluent in the language of data interpretation.

Excited to apply her skills to an issue closer to her heart, she joined a policy team supporting single family homeowners facing eviction. Coming from the transportation sector, she was surprised how complicated eviction and demographic data could be compared to the easily measurable and highly precise transportation data.

In her new position, half of June’s role focuses on working with data analysts to collect relevant data sets and translate them into meaningful advocacy materials—often in the form of reports, maps, and graphs for her coworkers to take to Albany when speaking with policymakers.

More interestingly, the other half of her role is focused on working with community organizers, tenants rights organizations, and lawyers to ensure that her work is useful to these partners. These relationships are important to June. Often these coalitions don’t have the staff time or skills to dig deeply into public data and look to her for help identifying trends and recommending policy actions.

## Experience Using Open Data

June and her organization have a lot of passion—for them, what matters is not just having good data available to communities, but helping people use that information to fight gentrification. This focus on outcomes has pushed June to think creatively about how to make data both navigable and relevant.

Rather than simply offering partners a collection of maps or graphs, June is currently working with her advocates to define what each of them might use the data for with the goal of building different frameworks to guide data-driven decisionmaking. For example, to help an organization understand the financial means of a neighborhood, she has developed a framework that draws on citywide salary and demographic data and asks users to compare it to a specific set of neighborhood data.

June seems to eat sleep and breath data interpretation. In her spare time, she has found a few friends to help her crowdsource data through Facebook comments and historical archives to map gentrification patterns. She plans on using projections to create an interactive background for a performance art piece.
