    “We don’t want to be the stereotype, and we don’t want to be tone deaf to the communities who have been working on these issues for years. For us, it’s not about how quickly we can get the data out there, but rather it’s about the impact.”

  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Shortly after graduating from NYU, June began working at a think tank focused on transportation issues for New York. In her role, she was quickly confronted with massive amounts of data and very little experience. During her first few months, she relied on coworkers to explain the technicalities of transportation data in layman’s terms. With the help of her supportive and tech-savvy relationships she became fluent in the language of data interpretation.</p>

<p>Excited to take her skills to issue close to her heart, she joined a policy team supporting single family homeowners facing eviction. Coming from the transportation sector, she was surprised how complicated eviction and demographic data could be compared to the easily measurable and highly precise transportation data.</p>

<p>In her new position, half of June’s role focuses on working with data analysts to collect relevant data sets and translate them into meaningful advocacy materials—often in the form of reports, maps or graphs for her coworkers to take to Albany when speaking with policymakers.</p>

<p>More interestingly, the other half of her role is focuses on working with community organizers, tenants rights organizations, and lawyers to ensure that her work is useful to these partners. These relationships are important to June and often these coalitions don’t have the staff time or skills to dig deeply into public data and look to her for help searching through the data.</p>

<h2 id="experience-using-open-data">Experience Using Open Data</h2>

<p>June and her organization have a lot of passion—for them, what matters is not just having good data available to communities, but how they use the data to fight gentrification.  This focus on outcomes has pushed June to think creatively about how to make data both navigable and relevant.</p>

<p>June is currently working with her partners to define what each might do with the data so she can build frameworks to guide data-driven decisionmaking. For example, to help an organization understand the financial means of a neighborhood, she has developed a framework that draws on citywide salary and demographic data and asks users to compare it to a specific set of neighborhood data.</p>

<p>June seems to eat sleep and breath data interpretation. In her spare time, she has found a few friends to help her crowdsource data through facebook comments and historical archives to map gentrification patterns. She plans on using projections to create an interactive background for a performance art piece.</p>
