## Background

Sarah is a web developer living in Queens. She’s currently enrolled at Queensborough Community College, majoring in computer science. Living in Queens, Sarah isn’t particularly connected to her community. She is aware of events happening, but spends her free time studying, or learning online, in forums.

## Experience Using Open Data

In one of her classes Sarah had to choose an open dataset to use for a data visualization project. She used the NYC Open Data Portal to download xx, and create a visualization of the data. The dataset was helpful in helping her learn the visualization library, but it didn’t feel like she could do anything with the data.

Sarah frequently works with data in school, and understands why businesses value data and research. Open data, however, isn’t clear to her.
