## Background

Sarah dreams of being a web developer. She is currently enrolled at Queensborough Community College, majoring in computer science. Even though she has lived in Queens her whole life, Sarah doesn’t feel particularly connected to her community. She is aware of events happening, but most of her time is dedicated to either studying, or learning online, in forums. When she is not studying, she plays basketball, a sport she has played since she was little.

She grew up in Jamaica, Queens, where her parents encouraged her early interest in physics and math. For as long as she remembers, she has been interested in solving everyday problems through numbers. For example, in high school she would take part in projects with her school Science and Engineering Club where they would send out questionnaires to the student body about the state of the school and write an analytical report based on survey results. At college, she enjoys taking classes that incorporate situations she would face in her everyday life, such as when she plays basketball, or rides the subway home to her parents’ house. But beyond taking the subway, she rarely uses public services in her neighborhood like the local library or the LinkNYC station they just set up.

Although Sarah is not connected to her community, she is closely connected to her family. Her parents and older brother run a business selling accessories to local stores that they import from the Caribbean, where Sarah has relatives. She will help her family with the business at times.  For example, last year, Sarah and her brother conducted a survey of 60 customers to better understand what they were looking for, asking among other things about price and variety of options. Her analysis of the survey results helped her family tailor their business to provide what people wanted.

## Experience Using Open Data

Sarah mostly accesses data at school and has learned that  businesses value data and research. Open data, however, isn’t clear to her. She doesn’t see a direct application for the data she found on the Open Data portal, beyond making people more informed.

In one of Sarah’s classes, her instructor told her to choose a dataset from the NYC Open Data Portal to use for a data visualization project. She downloaded a dataset on noise complaints that had been made in Queens in the past year, because she remembered making a noise complaint about some construction near her house a few months ago. She thought it was really cool that the city had pulled together all that data and enjoyed creating the visualization of the data and learning the visualization library. But it didn’t feel like she could do anything more with the data, and she didn’t see herself using the portal except for on a school assignment like this one.

In contrast, Sarah recalls another assignment for a physics class, where she was asked to solve a physics problem related to her daily life. She took the opportunity to determine what angle her arm should be at to get a basketball to move at the right velocity. When she was able to get the right information to analyze and solve that problem, she was excited to apply it because she could see how this new information could help her improve her own skills.
